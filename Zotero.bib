	abstract = {Familiarity is a precondition for trust, claims Luhmann [28: Luhmann N. Trust and power. Chichester, UK:
Wiley, 1979 (translation from German)], and trust is a prerequisite of social behavior, especially regarding
important decisions. This study examines this intriguing idea in the context of the E-commerce involved in inquiring
about and purchasing books on the Internet. Survey data from 217 potential users support and extend this
hypothesis. The data show that both familiarity with an Internet vendor and its processes and trust in the vendor
in¯uenced the respondents' intentions to inquire about books, and their intentions to purchase them. Additionally,
the data show that while familiarity indeed builds trust, it is primarily people's disposition to trust that aected their
trust in the vendor. Implications for research and practice are discussed. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

from particular types of components [Shaw 95]. This paper extends the descriptions
of those patterns (plus one) in response to the discussion at the conference.
Most significantly, it adds information on the kinds of problems each pattern
handles best},
